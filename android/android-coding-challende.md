# Tandem Mobile Coding Challenge

## OpenWeather

Use the OpenWeather API (<http://openweathermap.org/forecast5)> to retrieve data for a specific city in the UK. Use this data to display a weather forecast showing the weather every 3 hours for the next 5 days.

Present the data in a visual layout, where every day is a row and every 3-hour weather forecast is a cell. The user must be able to scroll the cells within the row.

Each row should clearly show the date and each cell in the row should clearly show the temperature and time of the day.

Show the city details as well.

## Optional ‘nice to haves’

- Show the corresponding weather icon in each cell
- Allow user to select location within UK
  
## Instructions

- Code in Kotlin or Java
- Use of 3rd party libraries (and dependency management) is accepted and encouraged.
- Tests are important to us. So we expect you to show that you know how to unit test your code. We know you are super busy. Instead of focusing on code coverage it is better to focus on testing a small part of the code really well.
- The application needs to compile from the command line so that we can build it ourselves.
- The application should handle configuration changes
- Send us a link to your code with commit history on github/bitbucket/gitlab etc. or a git bundle with all your commits

## Android project template

We have created a template Android project on github <https://github.com/tandembank/engineering-recruitment-resources/tree/master/android/tandem-weather-android-template> to save you the time of setting up a project from scratch. 
We do not want to force you to use any specific libraries.
Please feel free to change the classes, or add/remove any dependencies or start everything from scratch.
