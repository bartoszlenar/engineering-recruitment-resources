Backend Engineering - dotnet coding challenge
===================================================================

The objective of the coding challenge is to see how you approach and breakdown a simple programming task.

Coding challenge
----------------

[Our current code challenge can be found here](backend-coding-challenge.md). The coding challenges consists of two scenarios.

In the face-to-face stage of the interview process we will work through a third scenario as a peer programming exercise.

Make your solution available via github or bitbucket and add a README explaining the frameworks used and how to build and run the solution.

No time limit is imposed, the challenge is designed to be completable within an hour, but open-ended enough for you to showcase your skills beyond the basics if you desire.

You may use any libraries/frameworks/bootstraps you like 


How we review your code
-----------------------

As you have taken the time to provide us with your code, we will take the time to review it seriously:

* Your solution will be reviewed by two engineers.
* We will take into consideration your experience level, and adjust expectations accordingly.
* We will use your code to refer to as a further talking point in subsequent face to face interviews.


What we look for
----------------

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave portions aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us understanding how you approach a technical challenge. You should consider this code ready for a pull request for your colleague to review.

Aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Correctness**: does the solution fulfil the brief? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
* **Technical/architectural choices**: do choices of libraries, architecture, framework etc. seem appropriate?
* **Security**: are there any obvious vulnerabilities?
* **Testing**: how thorough are the test suites? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are they brittle?
	* We're not looking for full coverage, simply getting a feel for your testing approach and skills.
